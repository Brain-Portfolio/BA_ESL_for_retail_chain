** Introduction: This repository serves as my professional portfolio, organized
into three main folders: Retail_Chain_Project_BA_Anton_Samoilov, Academic
Experience and Anton Samoilov Main Application Documents.

** The Academic Experience folder contains my qualification thesis 
and my certificates gained during univercity studies.

**The Anton Samoilov Main Application Documents folder has PDF files, with
my EFSET certificate confirming B2 (against C1) English proficiency, which I consider to be my
current working level, the consolidated
Retail_Chain_Project_BA_Anton_Samoilov_Full_Documentation_In_One.pdf,
recommendation letter from Citrus Kyiv Regional Manager - Vadym Popov
and my CV.

**The Retail_Chain_Project_BA_Anton_Samoilov folder represents my core
Business Analyst portfolio, structured by key project phases such as Initiation,
As-Is analysis, To-Be design, and related documentation.

**For this project, I utilized Camunda Modeler for BPMN diagrams, my salesperson background
experience and actively engaged in Business Analysis webinars (both Ukrainian and English)
to deepen my understanding and practical skills.
